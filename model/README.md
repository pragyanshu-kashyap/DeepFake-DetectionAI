# Model File Download Instructions

The model file `best.pt` is required for this project but is too large to be included in the Git repository. Please follow these steps to set up the model:

1. Download the model file:

   - Option 1: Request access by emailing bhagabanpauloffcial@gmail.com
   - Option 2: [Download from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/your-folder-id) (Contact repository owner for access)

2. Place the downloaded `best.pt` file in this directory (`model/`).

3. Verify that the file structure looks like this:
   ```
   model/
   ├── best.pt
   └── README.md
   ```

Note: The model file is approximately 216MB in size. Make sure you have enough space available.
